<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

### Built With

- [Shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- If you're accessing a bastion server, ensure that your IPV4 address is whitelisted by the server.
- If you're using this to connect to a database, make sure you install the respective database client on your computer.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jasoncorneliog/ssh-config-bastion.git
```

2. Rename your .pem key to secret.pem, and Place the secret.pem key under the /Port_Forwarding folder.

3. Configure the /Port_Forwarding/ssh_config file by editing the following fields. You can CTRL + F the following and replace it with your respective variables. If you changed the database name, change it in the port_forward.sh file too.

```
database - Change it to your preferred alias of the database.
bastion_ip - Change this to the IP of the bastion server.
user_name - Change this to your default username.
secret.pem - Rename this to the filename discussed in step 2.
db_port - Port of the database.
database_host.amazonaws.com - The name of the database you're trying to connect to.
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Run the shell script within the /Port_Forwarding folder to update ssh-config.

```
cd Port_Forwarding
sh port_forward.sh
```
